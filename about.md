I am a data scientist at the Kakaobank Corp, Republic of Korea. Prior to my current appointments, I was a research professor at [Yonsei University College of Medicine](http://www.yonsei.ac.kr), research scientist at [National Institute for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.nims.re.kr), and clinical scientist at [Philips Korea](https://www.philips.co.kr/). I was interested in network-based understanding of the human behavior and underlying mechanism of the human decision making.

At Kakaobank, I am currently involved in the various datascience projects such as fraud detection, anonaly detection, recommandation systems. I am also involved in a role named as "data production" which is a kind of data planning job. Apart from professional role in data science, I am very passionate about teaching and consulting.
