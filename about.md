I am a Researcher at the Institute of Behavioral Science in Medicine of the [Yonsei University College of Medicine](http://www.yuhs.or.kr){:target="_blank"}, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Prior to my current appointments, I was a researcher at [National Institute for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.nims.re.kr){:target="_blank"} and MR clinical scientist at [Philips Korea](https://www.philips.co.kr/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include the effects of meditation on neural network, translational medicine, computational psychiatry, controllability in brain network, and data-based phenotyping of medical diseases. 

Apart from research, I am very passionate about teaching. Over the last couple of years, I have taught lab courses in Neuroimaging data analysis for those who are interested. More details of my teaching journey can be found [here](https://github.com/skyeong/Lectures_on_Neuroimaging){:target="_blank"}.

More information on my academic journey can be found in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-DFPpgutmKSTzlaM0U3VVZTQW8/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

Apart from all this, I love theatre, meeting new people, travelling and reading. Feel free to write to me with any questions or opportunities in teaching or theatre that you think will interest me.
